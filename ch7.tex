\section{Chapter VII}
\translation{
Nunc vero quae tua est ista vita? Sic enim iam tecum loquar, non ut odio permotus esse videar, quo debeo, sed ut misericordia, quae tibi nulla debetur. Venisti paulo ante in senatum. Quis te ex hac tanta frequentia totque tuis amicis ac necessariis salutavit? Si hoc post hominum memoriam contigit nemini, vocis expectas contumeliam, cum sis gravissimo iudicio taciturnitatis oppressus? Quid, quod adventu tuo ista subsellia vacuefacta sunt, quod omnes consulares, qui tibi persaepe ad caedem constituti fuerunt, simul atque adsedisti, partem istam subselliorum nudam atque inanem reliquerunt, quo tandem animo hoc tibi ferundum putas?

17. Servi mehercule mei si me isto pacto metuerent, ut te metuunt omnes cives tui, domum meam relinquendam putarem; tu tibi urbem non arbitraris? et, si me meis civibus iniuria suspectum tam graviter atque offensum viderem, carere me aspectu civium quam infestis omnium oculis conspici mallem; tu cum conscientia scelerum tuorum agnoscas odium omnium iustum et iam diu tibi debitum, dubitas, quorum mentes sensusque volneras, eorum aspectum praesentiamque vitare? Si te parentes timerent atque odissent tui neque eos ulla ratione placare posses, ut opinor, ab eorum oculis aliquo concederes. Nunc te patria, quae communis est parens omnium nostrum, odit ac metuit et iam diu nihil te iudicat nisi de parricidio suo cogitare; huius tu neque auctoritatem verebere nec iudicium sequere nec vim pertimesces? 

18. Quae tecum, Catilina, sic agit et quodam modo tacita loquitur: `Nullum iam aliquot annis facinus exstitit nisi per te, nullum flagitium sine te; tibi uni multorum civium neces, tibi vexatio direptioque sociorum inpunita fuit ac libera; tu non solum ad neglegendas leges et quaestiones, verum etiam ad evertendas perfringendasque valuisti. Superiora illa, quamquam ferenda non fuerunt, tamen, ut potui, tuli; nunc vero me totam esse in metu propter unum te, quicquid increpuerit, Catilinam timeri, nullum videri contra me consilium iniri posse, quod a tuo scelere abhorreat, non est ferendum. Quam ob rem discede atque hunc mihi timorem eripe; si est verus, ne opprimar, sin falsus, ut tandem aliquando timere desinam.'

  Now indeed what is that life of yours? For let me speak with you in this way now, not to seem moved by hatred, by which I ought to be, but to seem moved by pity, which is in no way owed to you. You came a little beforehand into the senate. Who from this great crowd greeted you, who out of your friends and relatives? If this has happened to no one in the memory of mankind, are you waiting for their spoken abuse, since you have been overwhelmed by the very weighty judgement of silence? What of the fact that on your arrival, these benches were emptied, the fact that all the men of consular rank, who were very often marked out by you for slaughter, as soon as you sat down, they left that part of the benches bare and empty, with what feelings, pray, do you think this is to be endured by you?

  Good heavens, if my slaves feared me in the same way that all the citizens fear you, I could think that I must leave my home: do you not think that you must leave the city? And if I saw that I was wrongly suspected so gravely and hated by my own citizens I would prefer to be deprived of the gaze of the citizens than to be looked upon by the hostile eyes of all. Do you, although you recognise with a clear knowledge of your crimes that the hatred of all is just and has been owed to you for a long time now, hesitate to avoid the gaze and presence of those whose minds and feelings you assault? If your parents feared and hated you and you couldn’t please them by any means, you would be withdrawing, so I think, to some place away from their eyes: now the fatherland, which is the common parent of us all, hates and fears you and for a long time now has judged that you have been thinking about nothing except its parricide: will you neither fear its authority, nor follow its judgement, nor be frightened of its force?

  Your country deals with you in this way, and, though silent, it speaks with you in some way as follows: `No crime has existed now for several years except because of you, no scandal without you; in your case alone you the deaths of many citizens, in your case alone the harassment and plundering of allies was unpunished and unchecked; you were strong enough not only to ignore the laws and the courts but also to overturn and shatter them. Although they were unbearable, I put up with those former actions, as best I could: but now in truth I am totally in fear on account of you alone, that Catiline is to be feared whenever a rumour spreads, that no plan against me can seem to be perpetrated which is not linked to your criminality. For this reason, leave, and take this fear from me, if this fear is real, so I won’t be overwhelmed, but if it is not real, may I at long last cease to be afraid.'
