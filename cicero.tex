Fuit, fuit ista quondam in hac re publica virtus, ut viri fortes acrioribus suppliciis civem perniciosum quam acerbissimum hostem coercerent. Habemus senatus consultum in te, Catilina, vehemens et grave; non deest rei publicae consilium neque auctoritas huius ordinis: nos, nos, dico aperte, consules desumus.

    Just how far, I ask, will Catiline misuse our tolerance? For how long still will that madness of yours make fun of us? To what end will your unbridled audacity boast of itself? Hasn’t the nightly garrison on the Palatine moved you, haven’t the patrols of the city, hasn’t the fear of the people, hasn’t the agreement of all the good men, hasn’t this very fortified place for holding the senate, haven’t the faces and expressions of these men moved you? Do you not realise that your plans are exposed? Do you not see that your conspiracy, already bound up, is being held by the knowledge of all these men? Which of us do you judge to be unaware of what you did last night, and the night before, where you have been, which men you have assembled, what plan you have adopted?

    What times, what conduct! The senate knows of these things, the consul sees: yet this man lives. He lives? Or rather in truth he still comes into the senate, he is made a participant of public council, he marks and notes with his eyes each one of us for the slaughter. But we, brave men, seem to do enough for the republic, should we avoid the furor and missiles of that man. You, Catiline, ought to have been led to death long ago now by order of the consul, that destruction which you are divising against us ought to have been brought on to you.
    \pend
    \pstart
    But in truth, Publius Scipio, a highly distinguished man, pontifex maximus, while he was a private citizen, killed Tiberius Gracchus when he was somewhat weakening the state of the republic: will we consuls put up with Catiline, wishing to lay waste to the world by means of murder and arson? For I leave out too much of those old examples, namely the fact that Gaius Servilius Ahala killed Suprius Maelius, studying the revolution, with his own hand. There was, there was once such virtue in this republic that brave men repressed a destructive citizen with more harsh punishment than the worst enemy. We have an agreement of the senate against you, Catiline, strong and serious, the republic does not lack resolution nor authority of this order: we, I say openly, we consuls are lacking.

    4. Decrevit quondam senatus, ut L. Opimius consul videret, ne quid res publica detrimenti caperet; nox nulla intercessit; interfectus est propter quasdam seditionum suspiciones C. Gracchus, clarissimo patre, avo, maioribus, occisus est cum liberis M. Fulvius consularis. Simili senatus consulto C. Mario et L. Valerio consulibus est permissa res publica; num unum diem postea L. Saturninum tribunum pl. et C. Servilium praetorem mors ac rei publicae poena remorata est? At vero nos vicesimum iam diem patimur hebescere aciem horum auctoritatis. Habemus enim huiusce modi senatus consultum, verum inclusum in tabulis tamquam in vagina reconditum, quo ex senatus consulto confestim te interfectum esse, Catilina, convenit. Vivis, et vivis non ad deponendam, sed ad confirmandam audaciam. Cupio, patres conscripti, me esse clementem, cupio in tantis rei publicae periculis me non dissolutum videri, sed iam me ipse inertiae nequitiaeque condemno.

Si te iam, Catilina, comprehendi, si interfici iussero, credo, erit verendum mihi, ne non potius hoc omnes boni serius a me quam quisquam crudelius factum esse dicat. Verum ego hoc, quod iam pridem factum esse oportuit, certa de causa nondum adducor ut faciam. Tum denique interficiere, cum iam nemo tam inprobus, tam perditus, tam tui similis inveniri poterit, qui id non iure factum esse fateatur.

    The senate has decreed long ago, for consul Lucius Opimius, to see that the republic experiences no harm: not one night intervened; Gaius Gracchus, killed on account of some suspicion of treachery, descended from a very famous father, grandfather, ancestors; Marcus Fulvius, of consular rank, was killed with his children. By a similar decree of the senate, the republic was entrusted to consuls Gaius Marius and Lucius Valerius; surely death and the penalty inflicted by the state did not keep Lucius Saturnius, tribune of the people, and Gaius Servilius, praetor, waiting a single day afterwards? But in contrast, it is now the 20th day that we have allowed the sharp edge of the authority of these men to become blunt. For we have a decree of the senate of this kind, but it is enclosed in the records as if it is concealed in a sheath, in accordance with which decree it is fitting that you, Catiline, have been killed immediately. You live, and you live not to resign but to strengthen your audacity. I wish, senators, that I be merciful, I wish that I do not seem careless in such great dangers of the republic, but I now condemn me myself of inaction and negligence.

    There is a camp in Italy aimed against the Roman people, located in the narrow passes of Etruria, the number of enemies grows day by day, but you see the general of that camp and the leader of the enemy within the city walls and actually in the senate, every day devising some internal destruction of the republic. If I order you to be arrested, Catiline, if I order you to be killed, I believe, I will have to fear, I suppose, not that all loyal men will say I have acted too late, but that someone will say that I have been too cruel. But I am not yet induced to do what ought to have been done long ago. Only then will you be killed, when no one so wicked, so corrupt, so similar to you will be able to be found, who does not admit that it has not been done in accordance with the law.
    \pend
    \pstart
    As for a long time there will be anyone at all that dares to defend you, you will live, but you will live in such a way, that you live, besieged by my many strong garrisons, so that you will be unable to move yourself against the republic. Moreover, the eyes and ears of many men will still be watching you, unaware.
