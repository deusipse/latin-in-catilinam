\section{Chapter III}
\translation{
  Etenim quid est, Catilina, quod iam amplius expectes, si neque nox tenebris obscurare coetus nefarios nec privata domus parietibus continere voces coniurationis tuae potest, si illustrantur, si erumpunt omnia? Muta iam istam mentem, mihi crede, obliviscere caedis atque incendiorum. Teneris undique; luce sunt clariora nobis tua consilia omnia; quae iam mecum licet recognoscas.

  7. Meministine me ante diem XII Kalendas Novembris dicere in senatu fore in armis certo die, qui dies futurus esset ante diem VI Kal. Novembris, C. Manlium, audaciae satellitem atque administrum tuae? Num me fefellit, Catilina, non modo res tanta, tam atrox tamque incredibilis, verum, id quod multo magis est admirandum, dies? Dixi ego idem in senatu caedem te optumatium contulisse in ante diem V Kalendas Novembris, tum cum multi principes civitatis Roma non tam sui conservandi quam tuorum consiliorum reprimendorum causa profugerunt. Num infitiari potes te illo ipso die meis praesidiis, mea diligentia circumclusum commovere te contra rem publicam non potuisse, cum tu discessu ceterorum nostra tamen, qui remansissemus, caede te contentum esse dicebas?

  8. Quid? cum te Praeneste Kalendis ipsis Novembribus occupaturum nocturno impetu esse confideres, sensistine illam coloniam meo iussu meis praesidiis, custodiis, vigiliis esse munitam? Nihil agis, nihil moliris, nihil cogitas, quod non ego non modo audiam, sed etiam videam planeque sentiam.

  And as a matter of fact what is, Catiline, what more can you expect, if neither the night can obscure your evil meetings with darkness nor can a private house contain the voices of your conspirators with its walls, if everything is lit up, if everything is bursting out? Change that mind of yours already, believe me, forget about slaughter and arson. You are held from all sides; all. Your plans are clearer to use than light; which now you may review with me.

  Do you all remember that I said in the senate on October 21st that Gaius Manlius, the accomplice and servant of your reckless attempt would be in arms on a certain fixed day which was going to be the 27th of October? Surely, Catiline, I was not mistaken about not only such a great matter, so atrocious and unbelievable, but, much more remarkable, the day? I likewise said in the senate, that you had fixed the slaughter of the nobles for the 28th of October, at a time when many leading citizens had fled from Rome not so much for the sake of saving themselves, as for supressing your plans. Surely you cannot deny that you could not have moved against the republic on that very day, because you were shut in by my many guards, my diligence; while you were saying that you were content with the departure of the rest, with my murder, I who had remained behind.

  Well. Although you were confident that you would seize control of the Palestrina on the very first day of November by a nocturnal attack, did you realise that the colony was fortified by my command with my guards, sentinels, and patrols? You do nothing, you labour at nothing, you plan nothing, which I do not not only hear, but also see and plainly realise.
