\section{Chapter II}

  4. Decrevit quondam senatus, ut L. Opimius consul videret, ne quid res publica detrimenti caperet; nox nulla intercessit; interfectus est propter quasdam seditionum suspiciones C. Gracchus, clarissimo patre, avo, maioribus, occisus est cum liberis M. Fulvius consularis. Simili senatus consulto C. Mario et L. Valerio consulibus est permissa res publica; num unum diem postea L. Saturninum tribunum pl. et C. Servilium praetorem mors ac rei publicae poena remorata est? At vero nos vicesimum iam diem patimur hebescere aciem horum auctoritatis. Habemus enim huiusce modi senatus consultum, verum inclusum in tabulis tamquam in vagina reconditum, quo ex senatus consulto confestim te interfectum esse, Catilina, convenit. Vivis, et vivis non ad deponendam, sed ad confirmandam audaciam. Cupio, patres conscripti, me esse clementem, cupio in tantis rei publicae periculis me non dissolutum videri, sed iam me ipse inertiae nequitiaeque condemno.

  5. Castra sunt in Italia contra populum Romanum in Etruriae faucibus conlocata, crescit in dies singulos hostium numerus; eorum autem castrorum imperatorem ducemque hostium intra moenia atque adeo in senatu videtis intestinam aliquam cotidie perniciem rei publicae molientem. Si te iam, Catilina, comprehendi, si interfici iussero, credo, erit verendum mihi, ne non potius hoc omnes boni serius a me quam quisquam crudelius factum esse dicat. Verum ego hoc, quod iam pridem factum esse oportuit, certa de causa nondum adducor ut faciam. Tum denique interficiere, cum iam nemo tam inprobus, tam perditus, tam tui similis inveniri poterit, qui id non iure factum esse fateatur.

  6. Quam diu quisquam erit, qui te defendere audeat, vives, sed vives ita, ut vivis, multis meis et firmis praesidiis obsessus, ne commovere te contra rem publicam possis. Multorum te etiam oculi et aures non sentientem, sicut adhuc fecerunt, speculabuntur atque custodient.

  The Senate has decreed long ago, for Lucius Opimius, consul, to see that the republic experiences no harm: darkness obstructed nothing; Gaius Gracchus was killed on account of some suspicion of treachery, descended from a very famous father, grandfather, ancestors; Marcus Fulvius, of consular rank, was killed with is children. By a similar decree of the Senate, the republic was entrusted to consuls Gaius Marius and Lucius Valerius; surely the death penalty inflicted by the state did not keep Lucius Saturnius, tribune of the people, and Gaius Servilius, praetor, waiting a single day afterwards? But in contrast it is now the 20th day that we have allowed the sharp edge of the authority of these men to become blunt. For we have a decree of the senate of this kind, but it is enclosed in the records as if it is concealed in a sheath, in accordance with which decree it is fitting that you, Catiline, have been killed immediately. You live, and you live not to resign but to strengthen your audacity. I wish, senators, that I be merciful, I wish that I do not seem careless in such. Great dangers of the republic, but I now condemn me myself of inaction and negligence.

  There is a camp in Italy aimed against the Roman people, located in the narrow passes of Etruria, the number of enemies grows day by day, but you see the general of that camp and the leader of the enemy within the city walls and actually in the senate, every day devising some internal destruction of the republic. If I order you to be arrested, Catiline, if I order you to be killed, I believe, I will have to fear, I suppose, not that all loyal men will say I have acted too late, but that someone will say that I have been too cruel. But I am not yet induced to do what ought to have been done long ago. Only then will you be killed, when no one so wicked, so ruined, so similar to you, will be able to be found, who does not admit that it has not been done in accordance with the law.

  As long as there is anyone at all that dares to defend you, you will live, but you will live in such a way, as you do now, that you live, besieged by my many strong guards, so that you will be unable to move yourself against the republic. Moreover the eyes and ears of many will still be watching you unaware, just as they have done up to this point.
